# hello-world
My first github repository
My real name is Christina Engelbart. I'm Director of the Doug Engelbart Institute which I co-founded with my dad (Doug Engelbart) originally under the name Bootstrap Institute. Visit http://dougengelbart.org for more. Our mission is to further Doug Engelbart's strategic vision for boosting mankind's capabiity to address complex, urgent challenges collectively, which he came to call boosting society's collective IQ. I've distilled his thinking into an actionable practice called bootstrapping brilliance which is like Lean Startup on steroids. 

Many of you will recognize the name Doug Engelbart for his early technological contributions -- the mouse, hypermedia, teleconferencing, networked personal and organizational computing, etc. -- a constellation of breakthroughs designed to boost collective IQ. He later published a technology template for a world-wide open hyperdocument system (OHS) which also reads as a list of what's still largely missing in today's technology that is still needed to help boost our collective IQ. 

I joined github because: 

a. I'm using Fancybox to enhance our website experience is what brought me here today, 

b. I'm looking forward to OHS becoming a reality someday, which would likely happen on github or at least have a presence here;

c. it's a great example of a networked community of tool developers who care about open, evolutionary, community-supported development and use the same tools at a meta level to collectively reflect on and improve how they develop their tool-development tools (a case example of bootstrapping brilliance actually)

d. I've been hearing about github for years and finally checking in here!
